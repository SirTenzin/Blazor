> **Piston (Pub-API and Priv-API)**
    
     Piston is a Code Execution Engine made by the Engineer Man, This is similar to the script block in RuriLib.
     It functions outside of the OpenBullet 2 Instance Host, the Priv-API version runs on the Host of said API, 
     You have the option to your own Priv-API as the Pub-API is Rate Limited to 5 RPS.
